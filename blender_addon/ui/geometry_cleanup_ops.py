# Operators that clean up mesh geometry the solver rejects at Transfer:
# removing stray (isolated, faceless) vertices from STATIC colliders, and
# triangulating the faces whose tessellation has no usable rest shape. Both are
# surfaced as a button under the Transfer error label; the second also opens a
# dialog on the failed Transfer, because that error costs the artist an upload
# and reads as a wall of text in the status bar.
