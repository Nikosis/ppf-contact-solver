# A dedicated modal operator that drives apply_animation + MESH_CACHE
# self-heal from a modal-operator timer context. This is the only context
# where Blender 5.x permits the ID writes these involve (writes to the
# State PropertyGroup, modifier.cache_format, scene.frame_start, etc.).
# The addon's persistent bpy.app.timers tick is NOT permissive and
# therefore cannot drive these writes.
#
# The operator runs only while it has work, and MUST NOT become
# resident. Blender refuses to auto-save while any modal operator handler
# is attached to a window: its auto-save timer re-arms itself for another
# 10 ms instead of writing, for as long as such a handler exists. A pump
# that stays up for the addon's lifetime therefore defers auto-save
# forever, and the user gets no recovery file for the whole session
# while the addon is merely enabled. work_pending() is the single
# predicate deciding both when to start and when to finish.
