# Reads a group's spatial material maps into per-vertex weight arrays.
#
# A map varies one parameter across the surface: the effective value at a
# vertex is lerp(base, target, weight), with `base` the group's own slider (or
# that frame's animated value, so a parameter can be animated and mapped at
# once). Weight 0 reproduces the unmapped result exactly, which is what keeps
# the calibrated presets meaningful.
